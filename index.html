          <h3>Analogue to digital</h3>
          <p>Analogue signals are constantly changing, don’t have defined ranges and are often represented by waves. Digital data forms values, which fall within defined ranges and take only certain values. Input and output to a computer are often analogue, but processing is done with digital data. Conversion is needed. Digitising sound starts by taking a sample of the sound wave through a microphone at regular time intervals. A binary value is then given to each reading and measurements are then stored by computer on hard drive (analog to digital converter). Digitising sound can be described as how many bits are available for each sample (bit depth). </p>

          <h3>Digital to analogue conversion</h3>
          <p>When we play it back, sound will never be the same as analogue curve, but it will be as close as it can be depending on sample rate and interval. Digital sound can only be played back through digital to analogue converter. </p>
